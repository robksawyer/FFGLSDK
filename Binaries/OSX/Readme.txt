Host and Plugin Binaries for OSX
compiled by Trey Harrison - www.harrisondigitalmedia.com
--------------------------------------------------------

To test the binaries on OSX, run the binaries/OSX/FFGLHost executable. 

The host assigns the mouse X position to  plugin #1 parameter #0 and 
the mouse Y position to plugin #2 parameter #0.

The host is hard-coded to use FFGLHeat as plugin #1 and FFGLTime as
plugin #2. To use different plugins, you have to edit OSXMain.cpp and recompile.
